It predicts the selling price of a used car based on various features such as brand, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, owner history, mileage, engine capacity, maximum power, and number of seats.

The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment as an interactive **web application** using Streamlit.
